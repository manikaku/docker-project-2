__Project Update: Integrating DevOps Tools for Enhanced Security and CI/CD__ 

__Tools Used__

GitHub: For version control and code repository.

Jenkins: To automate the CI/CD pipeline.

Docker: For containerization of the application.

Trivy: For container image vulnerability scanning.

SonarQube: For static code analysis to ensure code quality.

OWASP: For checking the dependencies installation

__Process__

◾ Connected Jenkins to the GitHub repository for automated builds on code changes.

◾ Integrated SonarQube with Jenkins for automated code quality checks.

◾ Installed the dependencies

◾ Integrated OWASP security tests into the pipeline to identify vulnerabilities.

◾ Built and tagged the Docker image using Jenkins.

◾ Pushed the Docker image to DockerHub for easy access.

◾ Scanned the Docker images using Trivy to identify vulnerabilities.

◾ Run the container and deployed

This project was a great learning experience, and I'm excited to apply these skills in future projects!
