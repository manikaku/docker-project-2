Project Update: Integrating DevOps Tools for Enhanced Security and CI/CD 

ðŸ”§ Tools Used:

GitHub: For version control and code repository.

Jenkins: To automate the CI/CD pipeline.

Docker: For containerization of the application.

Trivy: For container image vulnerability scanning.

SonarQube: For static code analysis to ensure code quality.

OWASP: For checking the dependencies installation

ðŸ’  Plugins I Used:

SONAR SCANNER 

NODEJS

OWASP DEPENDENCY CHECK

DOCKER PIPELINE

Eclipse Temurin installerVersion 

ðŸ’  Process

â—¾ Connected Jenkins to the GitHub repository for automated builds on code changes.

â—¾ Integrated SonarQube with Jenkins for automated code quality checks.

â—¾ Installed the dependencies

â—¾ Integrated OWASP security tests into the pipeline to identify vulnerabilities.

â—¾ Built and tagged the Docker image using Jenkins.

â—¾ Pushed the Docker image to DockerHub for easy access.

â—¾ Scanned the Docker images using Trivy to identify vulnerabilities.

â—¾ Run the container and deployed

This project was a great learning experience, and I'm excited to apply these skills in future projects!
